I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Chung-Ang University, Seoul, working in the [**AutoML Lab**](http://ml.cau.ac.kr/). During my graduate studies, I have worked on feature selection, missing value imputation, computer vision, time series prediction, and generative AI. For my PhD, I aim to further specialize in **Reinforcement Learning and Autonomous Systems**, with a focus on developing efficient and reliable methods for real-world applications.
