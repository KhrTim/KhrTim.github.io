During my bachelor's studies at Electrotechnical University "LETI", I had the unique opportunity to assist my professor in assembling and launching what became the biggest Robotarium in Russia.

### Project Overview
A Robotarium is a remotely accessible multi-robot research facility that enables users to write algorithms and run experiments on real robots through a web interface, making robotics research more accessible and scalable.

### My Contributions
* **Hardware Assembly**: Participated in the physical assembly of robotic systems and infrastructure
* **System Integration**: Helped integrate various robotic components and sensors
* **Testing and Calibration**: Assisted in testing procedures and system calibration
* **Launch Preparation**: Contributed to the preparation phases leading to the official launch
* **Documentation**: Helped document assembly procedures and system configurations

### Technical Learning
* **Multi-Robot Systems**: Gained hands-on experience with coordinated robot systems
* **Robotics Hardware**: Deep understanding of robotic hardware integration
* **System Architecture**: Learned about large-scale robotic system design
* **Remote Access Systems**: Understanding of remote laboratory infrastructure
* **Quality Assurance**: Experience in testing and validation procedures

### Impact and Significance
This Robotarium became a significant research facility in Russia, enabling:
* Remote robotics research for students and researchers across the country
* Collaborative research opportunities without physical presence requirements
* Educational access to advanced robotics systems
* Advancement of multi-robot algorithm development and testing

### Skills Developed
* **Hardware Integration**: Practical experience with robotic system assembly
* **Project Management**: Large-scale project coordination and execution
* **Problem Solving**: Troubleshooting complex multi-system integration issues
* **Team Collaboration**: Working with professors and graduate students
* **Technical Documentation**: Creating and maintaining system documentation

### Research Foundation
This experience provided invaluable foundation for my current research interests in autonomous systems and reinforcement learning, giving me practical understanding of the hardware-software integration challenges in multi-agent robotic systems.
