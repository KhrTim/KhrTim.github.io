Unsupervised feature selection aims to reduce data dimensionality by eliminating redundant features while preserving the underlying structure and coherence of information in unlabeled data. While most existing methods focus on minimizing the entropy of the selected subset to promote compactness, the alternative approach of maximizing entropy remains largely underexplored. Notably, entropy maximization has shown promise in enhancing tasks such as information retrieval by promoting more balanced instance distributions compared to entropy minimization. In this study, the differences between entropy minimization and maximization are first illustrated using a toy dataset, demonstrating that maximizing joint entropy enhances the pattern discrimination ability of the selected features. To generalize this insight to real-world scenarios, a new score function is proposed that approximates joint entropy using low-order interactions, effectively addressing the challenges of high-dimensional entropy computation. Experimental results on 25 public datasets show that our method achieves superior performance in terms of pattern discrimination and clustering-related metrics.
