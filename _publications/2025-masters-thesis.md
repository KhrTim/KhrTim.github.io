This master thesis presents a comprehensive study on unsupervised feature selection methods that maximize joint entropy while enhancing pattern discrimination capabilities. The research contributes to the field of information theory and machine learning by developing novel algorithms for automated feature selection in complex datasets.

The work addresses the fundamental challenge of identifying relevant features in high-dimensional data without supervision, proposing methods that balance information preservation with computational efficiency. The thesis explores theoretical foundations of joint entropy and its application to feature selection, demonstrating improved performance over existing approaches.
