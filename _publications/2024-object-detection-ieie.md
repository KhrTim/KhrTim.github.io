Accurate object detection is crucial for autonomous vehicle operation. For the past decade, object detection for autonomous driving has been significantly improved by a great number of research papers and new methods. However, developing solutions that allow vehicles to function without human intervention is an ongoing area of research. A robust algorithm should be coupled with a comprehensive sensor setup to ensure the reliability of the autonomous vehicle system.

*Taxonomy diagram of object detection approaches for autonomous vehicles, categorizing current research trends and methodologies*

Development of such safe system is especially important for successfully dealing with adverse weather scenarios and safely guiding the vehicle through rain, snow, haze, and other natural phenomena. In this survey, we classify existing methods regarding object detection that are specifically used in the area of autonomous driving. Furthermore, we briefly describe ideas used in the current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we present a taxonomy diagram created based on our observations of the current state of research in this area.
